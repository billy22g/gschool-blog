Well, we're back from the holiday break and I haven't completely forgotten everything. Though it does seem that way because we're getting into APIs now, and it's incredibly frustrating trying to figure out how to access APIs from various services. I'm excited to continue to learn about them though as it's a necessary skill to operate in today's world where services are interactive and use one another's information to create a better user experience.

My vague goal for the next two months is to continue to become more self-sufficient with more and more programming parts. I need to have a strong understanding of the concepts and how to implement them, as I will be directing the future of our company's technology development. I'm nervous about it but I also think I'm in the right place to set ourselves up for success. 

I don't have an innate desire to be a programmer for the rest of my life, but I understand that for the time being it's a necessary skill for me to continue to develop. It has been tough to juggle my responsibilities for my business while still maintaining my focus on learning all the necessary skills to become a solid developer. I need to stay engaged to ensure I get the most out of the course, but it's easy to get distracted.

In order to stay engaged, I will continue to attend class and work closely with my group to learn the most I can throughout this next project. It's a battle between what I know is necessary and what I'm naturally driven to spend my time on, but I think I can continue to work hard and develop my skills.
