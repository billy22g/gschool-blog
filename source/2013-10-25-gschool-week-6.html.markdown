**Seventh Week of gSchool**

Last week we built our first web application in Sinatra. It was called Idea Box, but I'm not a huge fan of the idea of an idea box, so I decided to make mine a To Do List instead. I was pretty lost throughout the project in terms of the MVC model and how each piece spoke to the others. It was only after I went through a small Rails tutorial this weekend with some classmates that I realized I had learned quite a bit more than I thought last week.

I was able to thoroughly test my models, but did not really figure out how to test the controller and views. It felt good that testing the Ruby logic seemed to come so easy, but it was likely in some part due to the fact that we did the implementation beforehand sans testing, and then went back through and reimplemented it using TDD. This approach allowed me to more easily think through which test would come next.

Through building the web app, I realized that while I enjoy the business logic and problem solving, I abhor the layout and design part of development. Using CSS and layout to style each element was incredibly tedious and wasn't very rewarding (likely in part because I did not make a genuine attempt to make it look that good). That said, I'm hoping that as some of style techniques become more familiar, it will be less tedious and actually fun to do some styling and design.

Since the project was due on Thursday, we went to The Source Friday for a Code Retreat. It was my first ever Code Retreat, and I really had no idea what it would be like when we showed up. Throughout the morning, we implemented one project and in the afternoon another. We worked in groups and implemented each project four or five times, each time with different constraints (like no talking, one line of code at a time, no methods more than one line, no if statments, etc.). It was a cool experience, but mentally exhausting because we spent the whole day trying to figure out new ways to solve the same problem. My biggest positive takeaway from the Code Retreat was that I feel much more comfortable working with hashes because many of the contraints forced us to manipulate hashes to solve the problem.

I enjoyed the opportunity to work with many different people, and it was interesting to try to figure out why I worked with some people better than others. The environment had quite a few distractions, so that made it a bit more difficult to focus, but overall it was a great experience and I'm looking forward to doing it again.
