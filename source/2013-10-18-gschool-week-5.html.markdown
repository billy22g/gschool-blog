**Sixth Week of gSchool**

Today will mark the completion of our sixth week at gSchool. For the first five weeks, we learned pure Ruby and used the command line to run our applications. This week, we used Sinatra to integrate Ruby into a web application. Learning the MVC (Models-Views-Controllers) concept was difficult at first but became intuitive when we actually began to build something. In Sinatra, traditional Ruby files are our models and Sinatra acts as the controller to allow us to run those methods to output something a user expects in the view. The views are .erb files, which allows us to embed Ruby code into traditional HTML & CSS. The benefit for me of building web-applications is that I can actually see what I'm building and experiment with HTML & CSS to alter the look and feel of the application.

The beginning of this week was especially difficult because I did not at all understand what Sinatra was or how it fit in with what we'd been learning so far. My initial reaction was that I had just spent five weeks learning Mandarin, and now I was being expected to pick up Russian and Portugese in a few days. My response to this was to initially focus solely on the pure Ruby portions of the application and use test-driven development to reimplement it after going through the tutorial once. I found that after being faced with Sinatra and .erb files, the Ruby logic seemed relatively simple and intuitive. After tearing my hair out over the five previous weeks trying to learn Ruby from scratch, that was a pretty exciting feeling, even if I didn't get the Sinatra portion right away.

Because I'm brand new to programming, it helps me to be able to work with others the first time through a problem, and then reimplement it on my own. In this sense, it's been great to have a group around me to work with. I paired with Ben Horne the first run through the tutorial, and he helped clear up some concepts that I otherwise would not have understood. Working through and completing a difficult problem with someone else also makes the end more satisfying because you have someone to "celebrate" with. In a world where wins are few and far between, it's much more fun to share them with someone else.

Next week we have our first assessments of the course. My performance on those assessments likely depends on the difficulty of the problem(s) and how much I have to start with. I still have a very difficult time in starting with a blank slate and figuring out what to test, what code to begin with, and where to go from there. At least up to this point, I'm much more adept at finding bugs, working out logic to solve a problem within a larger problem, etc. That said, I'm looking forward to testing what I've learned thus far and identifying ways that I can continue to improve.
