Last week marked the completion of our first project that would actually be demoed (the spelling of that one sure is fun). I worked with Kevin and Bryana, and I think all of us really enjoyed working together. Ours was one of the only groups without an experienced programmer, so each step was difficult, but ultimately more rewarding than it would have been if we had someone leading the way through the difficult parts.

Luckily, we had a bit of help from my mentor, Alex Welch, who has been an amazing resource and incredibly helpful to me personally and to our group. He helped us get unstuck at a couple crucial junctures, and we were able to proceed from there on our own. A bit of an aside about Alex, he was a member of the U.S. Olympic Cycling Team, and never went to college. He's a brilliant programmer and designer and has been contracting with Pivotal Labs to work Lew Parker and the team at ATHN, an organization dedicated to improving care for people with bleeding disorders. Lew has been an amazing resource as well, and I've thoroughly enjoyed getting to know him. Between him and Alex, I feel incredibly blessed to have such amazing mentorship, undoubtedly a testament to the phenomenal network that gSchool provides.

We were very pleased with the outcome of our project given that it was our very first Rails app. It was challenging but ultimately very rewarding to build a pretty cool site while learning the basics of Rails specifically and web development more generally. I had a lot of fun solving some of the more complex problems associated with the project, and I was grateful to have Kevin to pull things together and help make it look good too.

This week, we learned the basics of Javascript and JQuery, and ran through in brief some of the ways we could use them. After doing some of the basics in class, Alex spent some time with me going through things a bit more in depth. He expressed interest in going through more front-end design concepts with me, which I'm really excited about learning.

Generally, coming from Ruby, I find Javascript to be quite painful and tedious, but I also see that it's necessary for a developer to at least have a working knowledge. The barrier to entry seems fairly high, but I'm excited to work a little more with Alex and in class to learn some of the cool behaviors we can create with Javascript. That reminds me of something Alex said which I thought was especially helpful in describing the roles of each piece of a web application: First is your HTML, which describes the structure of your site. Next is your CSS, which describes its style. Last is your Javascript, which describes the behavior of the site. Importantly, the HTML has no knowledge of the CSS or Javascript, but the reverse is not true. I found these concepts to be exceptionally helpful when working through the progression of web development.

To wrap up, I want to give a brief shoutout to my business partner, Tony Hatala. He's an active duty Marine pilot, and is currently serving at NAS Pensacola as a flight instructor. He has taken on a larger than anticipated role since I started gSchool and am no longer able to work on our business full time, but only on weekends and early mornings. Tony has juggled more than his fair share of responsibilities for as long as I've known him, and he's an incredibly impressive entrepreneur and an even better guy. Thanks Tony for supporting me and encouraging me to go down this path. I wouldn't be here in Denver learning all this stuff without your push.
