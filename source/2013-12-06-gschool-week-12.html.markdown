The past couple weeks have been difficult in that we're trying to integrate all the concepts we've learned over the past 3 months and use them to build a large and dynamic platform. I feel like I have a decent understanding of many of the concepts in isolation, but integrating them all into a functioning project has been very difficult.

I've been trying to work on a couple side projects to reinforce the skills we're learning, and it's frustrating running into stumbling blocks along the way. That said, I've felt the same way at various points throughout the three month period, and I've made significant progress. I wouldn't say I'm worried, but rather just frustrated. I'm impatient and want to just be able to build cool stuff right now.

Our project due right before Christmas is to take a restaurant from one of the last projects and build it into a multi-platform restaurant. The project has been incredibly frustrating the first week, but I'm excited to be working with Ben Lewis as he's an amazing programmer and I'm already learning quite a bit just from talking through problems with him. I've also been able to contribute a decent amount thus far even though he's a far more experienced programmer, so that's encouraging too. It has been difficult to figure out a solid workflow, especially the balance between fixing things that we know need to be fixed and making reasonable forward progress toward our desired goal.
