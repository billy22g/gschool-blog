**Fifth Week of gSchool**

The first focus week was very helful in reinforcing many of the fundamentals that I previously had a superficial understanding of but was not actually able to implement on my own. In rebuilding EventReporter with Jeff and the Progress Group, I was able to grasp how to extract unrelated logic from a method to place it into another method that made much more sense. It came together very nicely on Thursday when I refactored anagram completely on my own to make it very simple and comprehensible. That said, I still do not have a great grasp on how certain pieces fit together when it comes to testing and implementation. I can read and comprehend code quite well at this point, and I've become reasonably adept at debugging, but actually implementing something with more than one or two moving parts from scratch is quite daunting.

The Progress Group was awesome and I think the energy from everyone was really positive. It was a fun environment and I learned a ton from working directly with different people in the group. I find that it's far more effective for me to work with people that are at my skill level than to work with people far ahead or behind. I think being broken into smaller groups really allowed us to synthesize the information and concentrate on the things that were gaps for our entire group. Instead of only half the questions being relevant to everyone in the group, it was likely closer to 90% of the questions being relevant since we were all at a similar level.

I'm excited to get into web apps, as that's in large part why I came here. I started reading the HTML/CSS book so I'm excited to be able to integrate some of that. I'm also excited to get beyond the Pickaxe Reading Group, as reading that book has not been helpful to me at all. I think the integration of new elements (Sinatra, HTML/CSS, erb) on top of something I don't have the greatest grasp of (Ruby) will certainly be challenging, but I think the Ruby concepts will continue to be reinforced as we move forward and integrate other tools and languages. I'm also excited about the prospect of building something that I can actually do something with from a front-end perspective. Up to now, the end product of each of our projects has been somewhat opaque, so it'll be cool to actually be able to see the fruit of our labor more concretely.
